stimuli, learn their predictive value and use this knowledge to modify their behavior. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the mushroom body (MB) plays a key role in these processes. Sensory stimuli are sparsely represented by ∼2000 Kenyon cells, which converge onto 34 output neurons (MBONs) of 21 types. We studied the role of MBONs in several associative learning tasks and in sleep regulation, revealing the extent to which information flow is segregated into distinct channels and suggesting possible roles for the multi-layered MBON network. We also show that optogenetic activation of MBONs can, depending on cell type, induce repulsion or attraction in flies. The behavioral effects of MBON perturbation are combinatorial, suggesting that the MBON ensemble collectively represents valence. We propose that local, stimulus-specific dopaminergic modulation selectively alters the balance within the MBON network for those stimuli. Our results suggest that valence encoded by the MBON ensemble biases memory-based action selection.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04580.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04580.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04580.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>An animal's survival depends on its ability to respond appropriately to its environment, approaching stimuli that signal rewards and avoiding any that warn of potential threats. In fruit flies, this behavior requires activity in a region of the brain called the mushroom body, which processes sensory information and uses that information to influence responses to stimuli.</p><p>Aso et al. recently mapped the mushroom body of the fruit fly in its entirety. This work showed, among other things, that the mushroom body contained 21 different types of output neurons. Building on this work, Aso et al. have started to work out how this circuitry enables flies to learn to associate a stimulus, such as an odor, with an outcome, such as the presence of food.</p><p>Two complementary techniques—the use of molecular genetics to block neuronal activity, and the use of light to activate neurons (a technique called optogenetics)—were employed to study the roles performed by the output neurons in the mushroom body. Results revealed that distinct groups of output cells must be activated for flies to avoid—as opposed to approach—odors. Moreover, the same output neurons are used to avoid both odors and colors that have been associated with punishment. Together, these results indicate that the output cells do not encode the identity of stimuli: rather, they signal whether a stimulus should be approached or avoided. The output cells also regulate the amount of sleep taken by the fly, which is consistent with the mushroom body having a broader role in regulating the fly's internal state.</p><p>The results of these experiments—combined with new knowledge about the detailed structure of the mushroom body—lay the foundations for new studies that explore associative learning at the level of individual circuits and their component cells. Given that the organization of the mushroom body has much in common with that of the mammalian brain, these studies should provide insights into the fundamental principles that underpin learning and memory in other species, including humans.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>To survive in a dynamic environment, an animal must discover and remember the outcomes associated with the stimuli it encounters. It then needs to choose adaptive behaviors, such as approaching cues that predict food and avoiding cues that predict danger. The neural computations involved in using such memory-based valuation of sensory cues to guide action selection require at least three processes: (1) sensory processing to represent the identity of environmental stimuli and distinguish among them; (2) an adaptive mechanism to assign valence—positive or negative survival value—to a sensory stimulus, store that information, and recall it when that same stimulus is encountered again; and (3) decision mechanisms that receive and integrate information about the valence of learned stimuli and then bias behavioral output. To understand such decision-making processes, one approach is to locate the sites of synaptic plasticity underlying memory formation, identify the postsynaptic neurons that transmit stored information to the downstream circuit and discover how their altered activities bias behavior.</p><p>The mushroom body (MB) is the main center of associative memory in insect brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">de Belle and Heisenberg, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Heisenberg et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Dubnau et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">McGuire et al., 2001</xref>). While the MB processes several modalities of sensory information and regulates locomotion and sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Martin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Liu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Joiner et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Pitman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Hong et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Vogt et al., 2014</xref>), MB function has been most extensively studied in the context of olfactory memory—specifically, associating olfactory stimuli with environmental conditions in order to guide behavior. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, olfactory information is delivered to the MB by projection neurons from each of ∼50 antennal lobe glomeruli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Marin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Wong et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Jefferis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Lin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Vosshall and Stocker, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Yu et al., 2010</xref>). Connections between the projection neurons and the ∼2000 Kenyon cells (KCs), the neurons whose parallel axonal fibers form the MB lobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Crittenden et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aso et al., 2009</xref>), are not stereotyped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Murthy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Caron et al., 2013</xref>); that is, individual flies show distinct wiring patterns between projection neurons and KCs. Sparse activity of the KCs represents the identity of odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Laurent and Naraghi, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Perez-Orive et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Turner et al., 2008</xref>). The output of the MB is conveyed to the rest of the brain by a remarkably small number of neurons—34 cells of 21 cell types per brain hemisphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aso et al., 2014</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04580.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Circuit diagrams of the mushroom body.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The innervation patterns of extrinsic neurons define 15 compartments in the MB lobes and one compartment in the core of distal pedunculus (pedc); the compartments are represented by rectangles that are color-coded based on the neurotransmitter used by the mushroom body output neurons (MBONs) having dendrites in that compartment (green, glutamate; blue, GABA; orange, acetylcholine). Projection neurons (far left, colored arrows) from the antennal lobe convey olfactory sensory information to the MB calyx where they synapse on the dendrites of Kenyon cells (KCs). The parallel axon fibers of the KCs (gray lines) form the lobes (α/β, α′/β′ and γ) where KCs terminate onto the dendrites of the MBONs. Each of the seven types of KCs innervates a specific layer within a given lobe. The dendrites of individual MBON types and the terminals of dopaminergic neurons (DANs) intersect the longitudinal axis of KC axon-bundles in specific compartments along the lobes. MBONs using the same transmitter are spatially co-localized in the lobes (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Innervation areas of PPL1 and PAM cluster DANs axons in the MB lobes are indicated by the rectangles outlined in dashed lines. Activation of subsets of DANs can convey punishment or reward, respectively inducing aversive or appetitive memory when activation is paired with odor presentation. The size of arrows indicates magnitude of memory induced by DAN activation. See text for references. (<bold>B</bold>) Schematic representation of the 21 cell types of MBONs in the lobes and one cell type of MBON in the calyx based on the data presented in the accompanying manuscript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aso et al., 2014</xref>): circles, cell bodies; semicircles, dendrites; arrowheads, axon terminals; color-coding is by neurotransmitter as in panel (<bold>A</bold>) Three MBON cell-types (GABAergic MBON-γ1pedc&gt;α/β, glutamatergic MBON-γ4&gt;γ1γ2 and MBON-β1&gt;α; marked as 11, 5 and 6 respectively) send axons into the MB lobes. Axons of MBON-γ4&gt;γ1γ2 project from γ4 to γ1 and γ2, and thus have the potential to affect activity of MBON-γ1pedc&gt;α/β. From γ1, the axon of MBON-γ1pedc&gt;α/β projects to compartments in the α/β lobes including β1, where dendrites of MBON-β1&gt;α arborize. Axons of both MBON-γ1pedc&gt;α/β and MBON-β1&gt;α project to the compartments in the α lobe. Therefore activity of MBONs in the α lobe can be regulated by these layered inter-compartmental connections. These three types of MBONs (11, 5 and 6) do not project back to their own dendrites. Therefore, the organization of the MBONs can be viewed as forming a multilayered feed-forward network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aso et al., 2014</xref>). MBONs project to a small number of brain areas: the crepine (CRE; a region surrounding the horizontal/medial lobes), the superior medial protocerebrum (SMP), superior intermediate protocerebrum (SIP) and superior lateral protocerebrum (SLP) and the lateral horn (LH). The size of the arrowhead reflects the relative number of termini in each area. The MBONs are numbered and listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>.

For MBONs, we use MBON plus the name of MB lobe compartment(s) in which their dendrites arborize (for example, MBON-α1 for the MB output neurons that have dendrites in the α1 compartment; MBON-γ5β′2a for the MB output neurons that have dendrites in the γ5 compartment and the anterior layer of the β′2 compartment). For the three classes of MBONs which also have <italic>axon</italic> terminals in the MB lobes, the ‘&gt;’ symbol is followed by the compartments (or lobes) in which the axons terminate (for example, MBON-β1&gt;α for the MB output neuron with dendrites in β1 and synaptic terminals in the α lobe.). Subsets of MBONs have their cell bodies clustered, presumably reflecting their common developmental origin; these clusters are indicated. The neurotransmitter used by each MBON (where known) is indicated as is the number of cells of that type found per brain hemisphere (data from the accompanying manuscript; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aso et al., 2014</xref>). We also provide a short cell type name based on simple numbering; the number of an MBON corresponds to number shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. Many of these cell types have been previous described under alternative names, as indicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Tanaka et al., 2008</xref>).</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p>The information flow from the KCs to the MB output neurons (MBONs) has been proposed to transform the representation of odor identity to more abstract information, such as the valence of an odor based on prior experience (See discussion in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aso et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast to KCs, MBONs have broadly tuned odor responses; any given odor results in a response in most MBONs, although the magnitude of the response varies among MBON cell types (Hige et al., unpublished) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Cassenaer and Laurent, 2012</xref>). Unlike the stereotyped response to odors of the olfactory projection neurons that deliver odor information to the MB, the odor tuning of the MBONs is modified by plasticity and varies significantly between individual flies, suggesting that MBONs change their response to odors based on experience (Hige et al., unpublished).</p><p>For olfactory associative memory in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, multiple lines of evidence are consistent with a model in which dopamine-dependent plasticity in the presynaptic terminals of KCs alters the strength of synapses onto MBON dendrites. This is thought to provide a mechanism by which the response of MBONs to a specific odor could represent that odor's predictive value. D1-like dopamine receptors and components of the cAMP signaling pathway, such as the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Calmodulin-responsive adenylate cyclase encoded by the <italic>rutabaga</italic> gene, are required specifically in the KCs for memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Livingstone et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Zars et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Schwaerzel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">McGuire et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Gervasi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Qin et al., 2012</xref>) and <italic>rutabaga</italic> was shown to be required for the establishment of the differences in MBON odor tuning between individuals (Hige et al., unpublished). Reward and punishment recruit distinct sets of dopaminergic neurons (DANs) that project to specific regions in the MB lobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Mao and Davis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Burke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, exogenous activation of these DANs can substitute for reinforcing stimuli to induce either appetitive or aversive memory, depending on DAN cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Yamagata et al., in press</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Perisse et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Schroll et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Claridge-Chang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Aso et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Burke et al., 2012</xref>). In sum, while the identity of the learned odor is likely encoded by the small subset of KCs activated by that odor, whether dopamine-mediated modulation assigns positive or negative valence to that odor would be determined by where in the MB lobes KC-MBON synapses are modulated and thus which MBON cell types alter their response to the learned odor.</p><p>Combining the above observations with our comprehensive anatomical characterization of MB inputs and outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aso et al., 2014</xref>) lays the groundwork for testing models of how the MB functions as a whole. We suggest that each of the 15 MB compartments—regions along the MB lobes defined by the arborization patterns of MBONs and DANs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>)—functions as an elemental valuation system that receives reward or punishment signals and translates the pattern of KC activity to a MBON output that serves to bias behavior by altering either attraction or aversion. This view implies that multiple independent valuation modules for positive or negative experiences coexist in the MB lobes, raising the question of how the outputs across all the modules are integrated to result in a coherent, adaptive biasing of behavior.</p><p>Although several MBON cell types have been shown to play a role in associative odor memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Sejourne et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Pai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Placais et al., 2013</xref>), the functions of most MBONs have not been studied. Based on our anatomical analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aso et al., 2014</xref>), we believe that just 34 MBONs of 21 types provide the sole output pathways from the MB lobes. To gain mechanistic insight into how the ensemble of MBONs biases behavior, we would first like to know the nature of the information conveyed by individual MBONs and the extent to which their functions are specialized or segregated into different information channels. Then we need to discover how the activities of individual MBONs contribute to influence the behavior exerted by the complete population of MBONs. Thus, in order to understand how memory is translated into changes in behavior, we need to have experimental access to a comprehensive set of MBONs and investigate how the outputs from different MBONs bias behavior, singly and in combination.</p><p>In the accompanying paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aso et al., 2014</xref>), we describe the detailed anatomy of the DANs and MBONs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and the generation of intersectional split-GAL4 driver lines to facilitate their study. All but one of the 21 MBON cell types consists of only one or two cells per hemisphere (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Dendrites of MBONs that use the same neurotransmitter—GABA, glutamate or acetylcholine—are spatially clustered in the MB lobes. Intriguingly, this spatial clustering resembles the innervation patterns of modulatory input by two clusters of dopaminergic neurons, PPL1 and PAM. MBONs have their axonal terminals in a small number of brain regions, but their projection patterns also suggest pathways for relaying signals between compartments of the MB lobes; three MBONs send direct projections to the MB lobes and several other MBONs appear to target the dendrites of specific DANs.</p><p>Our split-GAL4 drivers give us the capability to express genetically encoded effectors in identified MBONs to modify their function. In this study, we examine the roles of specific MBONs in various learning and memory tasks as well as in the regulation of locomotion and sleep. We also studied whether direct activation of specific MBONs are sufficient to elicit approach or avoidance. Our results indicate that the ensemble of MBONs does not directly specify particular motor patterns. Instead, MBONs collectively bias behavior by conveying the valence of learned sensory stimuli, irrespective of the modality of the stimulus or the specific reward or punishment used during conditioning.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Strategy for assigning behavioral roles to MBONs</title><p>A powerful strategy to discover if a neuronal population plays a role in a particular behavior is to observe the effects of inactivating or activating those neurons. A genetic driver can be used to express an exogenous protein that either promotes or blocks neuronal activity. By repeating such manipulations with a large collection of drivers, each specific for a different set of neurons, one can in principle discover cell types required for a particular behavior. This is analogous to a screen to identify genes that when mutated disrupt a cellular function, but it is the activity of cells—rather than that of genes—being altered. This approach has been widely used in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (Reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Venken et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Griffith, 2012</xref>).</p><p>There are many challenges in carrying out such an approach. As in all biological systems, we expect extensive resiliency to perturbation. Such robustness might mask the effects of manipulating the activity of a small population of neurons, making them undetectable above the normal variation between animals. In addition to these inherent limitations, the genetic tools at our disposal have often been inadequate. In this study, we have used improved genetic tools and employed several strategies to mitigate their remaining limitations, as detailed below and in ‘Materials and methods’. By assaying many different behaviors with the same genetic reagents, we were better able to evaluate the specificity of the behavioral effects we observed. Our experimental design placed an emphasis on avoiding false positives. Extensive analysis was restricted to MBON lines showing a phenotype in the initial screens and our scoring criteria were conservative. Consequently, we are likely to have missed detecting some cell types with effects on the behavior under assay.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Photoactivation of MBONs can drive either approach or avoidance</title><p>We sought to first determine the nature of the information conveyed by MBONs. In the most widely used olfactory conditioning assay, memory is assessed after training by allowing flies to distribute between two arms of a T-maze: one arm perfused with a control odor and the other arm with an odor that had been previously associated with punishment or reward. If the valence of the learned odor were encoded by the altered activities of specific MBONs, artificial activation of those MBONs in untrained flies in the absence of odor presentation would be expected to result in avoidance or approach behavior that mimicked the conditioned odor response. To test this hypothesis, we used a circular arena in which groups of flies expressing the red-shifted channelrhodopsin CsChrimson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Klapoetke et al., 2014</xref>) in MBONs were allowed to freely distribute between dark quadrants and quadrants with activating red light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; see ‘Materials and methods’ for details). Activating sensory neurons for CO<sub>2</sub> or bitter taste in this manner induced strong avoidance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Suh et al., 2007</xref>). By testing our collection of MBON split-GAL4 drivers in this assay, we found cell types whose activation resulted in avoidance of the red light and others whose activation led to attraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Behavioral valence was highly correlated with MBON transmitter type: all MBONs eliciting aversion were glutamatergic and all the MBONs eliciting attraction were either GABAergic or cholinergic. We selected two split-GAL4 drivers for each neurotransmitter type for further analysis, choosing lines that gave robust phenotypes in the initial screening and that showed highly specific expression patterns based on direct assessment of CsChrimson expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–F</xref>). The phenotypes of these lines were reproducible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–I</xref>) and none of the drivers showed significant preference to the red light in the absence of the CsChrimson effector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), confirming that phototaxis was limited at the wavelength and intensity of light used. These results demonstrate that activation of MBONs is itself sufficient to elicit either approach or avoidance, depending on the cell type.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04580.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Screening MBONs for behavioral valence.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Behavioral valence assay.

The red-light preference index (PI) was defined as: [(number of flies in illuminated quadrants) - (number of flies in non-illuminated quadrants)]/(total number of flies). For each 2-min experiment, the overall PI was calculated by averaging the PIs from the final 5 s of each of the two red-lights-on conditions (namely, 55–60 s and 115–120 s). MBON cell types expressed in each driver are shown in the matrix below the graph; collectively all the drivers covered 20 of the 22 MBON types. MBON-γ3 and MBON-γ3β′1 are listed together, because these MBON cell types are always labeled together in our split-GAL4 lines. Driver lines shown in bold were selected for more detailed experiments.

For example, MB011B and MB052B, which drive expression in groups of three or five cell types that use the same transmitter (the glutamatergic M4/M6 and cholinergic V2 clusters, respectively; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), caused strong responses, while activation with drivers for smaller subsets or individual cell types within these groups had much reduced effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Although activation of the single cell types MBON-γ1pedc&gt;α/β or MBON-γ4&gt;γ1γ2 had a significant effect, these neurons send axonal projections to other compartments in the MB lobes, giving them the potential to directly influence the activity of additional MBON cell types. Given that multiple MBONs can independently contribute to behavioral valence as measured by attraction vs repulsion, we sought to determine how conflicting or consonant information from multiple MBONs is integrated to bias behavior. We combined two split-GAL4 drivers for cell types with either similar or opposite effects in the same fly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>; ‘Materials and methods’). When combining drivers eliciting similar responses, flies generally showed a stronger response than to either driver alone. Conversely, co-activation of MBON cell types with opposing effects resulted in intermediate responses. Together, these data are consistent with a simple combinatorial model of valence integration.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04580.009</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Additive effects of MBONs for attraction and repulsion.</title><p>PIs of individual drivers and combinations of drivers are shown when tested by the protocol shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>.

A conditioned response to a learned odor is unlikely to be achieved by eliciting a predetermined motor pattern. To carry out appropriate changes in speed and direction, a fly needs to evaluate both the valence of the learned odor and its own trajectory relative to the location of the odor source. To assess which aspects of locomotion are modified by MBON activation to generate a bias between approach and avoidance, we analyzed the behavior of flies in a 10 mm-wide graded lighting choice zone centered on the border between dark and illuminated quadrants. We tracked the trajectories of individual flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>) and calculated the fraction of flies crossing the choice zone from the ‘light-off’ to the ‘light-on’ area (and vice versa) as well as the fraction of flies changing direction in the choice zone thus returning to the area they came from.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04580.011</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>MBONs bias choice at the border.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Pseudo-colored light intensity in the behavioral arena.

The error bars show the 95% confidence interval. Between 79 and 410 trajectories were analyzed per genotype. Compared to the control, MB434B + MB011B, MB434B and MB011B showed a significantly lower fraction of trajectories that exit to the light-on side (more avoidance of light), whereas significantly higher fraction of trajectories of MB112C + MB077B flies exit to the light-on side (more attraction to the light); multiple comparisons with the Dunn-Sidak correction: ***, p &lt; 0.001. Similarly, the fraction of trajectories entering the choice zone from the illuminated side and then changing direction so as to also exit to the illuminated side is plotted for the indicated drivers in combination with CsChrimson (bottom).

Flies are able to adjust these parameters to execute avoidance behaviors in other contexts; we found that activation of some chemosensory neurons and projection neuron combinations that repelled flies significantly altered both walking and angular speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="video4">Video 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>).

With these parameters, only one line, MB112C, also showed significant memory impairment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>)<italic>.</italic> The experimental MB112C flies showed significantly lower memory performance than genetic control groups at the restrictive temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), but not at the permissive temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). These flies displayed normal shock and odor avoidance at the restrictive temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,F</xref>), indicating that the observed memory impairment was not due to a defect in sensory or motor pathways. MB112C drives expression in MBON-γ1pedc&gt;α/β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We confirmed the requirement for this cell type using a second driver, MB085C, not included in the original 23 lines screened (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>One of the PPL1 cluster dopaminergic neurons, PPL1-γ1pedc (also known as MB-MP1), innervates the same MB compartments as MBON-γ1pedc&gt;α/β. Blocking PPL1-γ1pedc activity, using the MB438B split-GAL4 driver, also impaired aversive memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–F</xref>). Conversely, activation of PPL1-γ1pedc with the temperature gated cation channel dTrpA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hamada et al., 2008</xref>) substituted for electric shock as the unconditioned stimulus (US), inducing robust aversive odor memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). This confirms a conclusion reached using less specific enhancer trap GAL4 drivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Aso et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2012</xref>). Consistent with these observations, restoring expression of the D1-like dopamine receptor specifically in the γ Kenyon cells has been shown to rescue the aversive odor memory defect of a receptor mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Qin et al., 2012</xref>).

All eight lines displayed normal memory at the permissive temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) and normal attraction to sugar at the restrictive temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D).</xref> Five of these lines (MB082C, MB093C, MB018B, MB051B and MB077B) express in subsets of the so-called V3/V4 cluster of cholinergic MBONs (MBON-γ2α′1, MBON-α′2 and MBON-α3; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), establishing a role for this group of MBONs in 2-hr appetitive memory. MB310C labels the glutamatergic MBON-α1.

Similarly, we observed that activating CsChrimson with MB011B, but not with MB210B or MB002B, produced a significant aversive effect (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These data are consistent with an additive role of these MBONs on behavior, which is further supported by the anatomical observation that the axon terminals of some of these MBONs converge to the same areas outside the MB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E,F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aso et al., 2014</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04580.020</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Requirement of MBONs for 2-hr appetitive odor memory.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Flies were trained and tested in a similar way as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, except that flies were starved for 28–40 hr prior to experiments and trained with a reward consisting of a tube covered with sugar absorbed filter paper.

These eight lines were not significantly different from controls in 30-min aversive memory, although two exhibited a trend towards decreased 30-min memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C</xref>); the ability to form memories at 30 min establishes that flies of these genotypes can sense the odors and learn to associate them with ethanol.</p><p>Our results indicate that MBON-γ4&gt;γ1γ2 (MB434B and MB298B) and MBON-α′2 (MB018B), whose involvement we confirmed with a second line not part of the original screening set (MB091C; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11E</xref>), are preferentially required for 24 hr memory.</p><p>Our data also suggest the involvement of MBON-γ2α′1, where one driver line (MB077B) had a strong effect, while the second driver (MB051B) had a weaker effect that did not reach statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11D</xref>). Our results raise the possibility of the involvement of MBON-α3. However, the two lines we have for this cell type (MB082C and MB093C) gave discordant results and MB082C shows significant expression in MBON-α′2, a cell type that has a large effect on appetitive ethanol memory. Finally, blocking M4/M6 cluster MBONs from γ5 and β′2 (MB011B and MB210B) significantly affected 24 hr memory, but also appeared to decrease 30 min memory. The MBONs required for 24 hr appetitive ethanol memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11F,G</xref>) are partially overlapping with those required for other forms of appetitive memory, again with involvement of multiple glutamatergic and cholinergic MBONs.</p><p>Silencing MBON-α′2, a cell type composed of just one cell in each hemisphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplement 1F,G</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aso et al., 2014</xref>), resulted in persistence of the aversive memory after 24 hr, when control flies show appetitive memory (see MB018B in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11D</xref> and MB091C in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12E</xref>). These results suggest that, while memories for the aversive and rewarding effects of ethanol intoxication are formed simultaneously, they are expressed at different times through independent MB circuits. Moreover, maintenance of the aversive memory upon inactivation of MBON-α′2 argues against a passive dissipation of the aversive memory with time, and implies an active process in the conversion of aversive to appetitive memory.<fig-group><fig id="fig12" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04580.029</object-id><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><title>MBONs bi-directionally regulate sleep.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Top: Schematic of the experimental apparatus used for assaying sleep.

We identified five MBON drivers that suppressed sleep and seven MBON drivers that increased sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12B</xref>). All five sleep-suppressing drivers express in glutamatergic MBONs (MBON-γ5β′2a, MBON-β′2mp, MBON-β′2a_bilateral and MBON-γ4&gt;γ1γ2), while sleep-promoting drivers express either in GABAergic (MBON-γ3β′1 and MBON-γ3) or cholinergic MBONs (MBON-γ2α′1); the neurotransmitter for MBON-calyx has not been determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12B</xref>). Despite the 48 hr period of dTrpA1 activation, the effects of activation were reversible and the temperature shift had only minor effects on sleep in genetic control groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12C</xref>). We retested the split-GAL4 drivers that showed a significant effect in the primary screening using a different dTrpA1 effector inserted at another genomic location, allowing us to assess expression more accurately since we had access to a reporter construct inserted at that site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s1">Figure 12—figure supplement 1</xref>); these assays confirmed the initial results for all but one of the split-GAL4 driver lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12D</xref>). None of the lines showed significant effects on general locomotion as assessed by video tracking (see ‘Materials and methods’). We identified distinct MBONs that either decrease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12E</xref>) or increase sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12F</xref>).

The behavioral response to these cues can be neutral, repulsive or attractive, influenced by the prior experiences of that individual and how dopaminergic and other modulatory inputs have changed the weight of its KC-MBON synapses. MBONs are thought to encode the predictive value associated with a stimulus. A fly would then use that information to bias its selection of behavioral responses in an ever-changing environment. In the accompanying paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aso et al., 2014</xref>), we describe in detail the projection patterns of the MBON and DAN cell types that comprise the MB lobes in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. In this report, we begin the process of determining the nature of the information conveyed by MBONs. We also correlate specific MBON cell types with roles in associative memory and sleep regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref>). Our anatomical and behavioral results lay the groundwork for understanding the circuit principles for a system of memory-based valuation and action selection.<fig id="fig13" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04580.032</object-id><label>Figure 13.</label><caption><title>A map of MBON functions.</title><p>A matrix summarizing the MBON cell types identified in each of the behavior assays is shown. In the cells of the matrix representing MBON cell types, solid colors were assigned when manipulation of that cell type alone caused a significant behavioral phenotype. Hatched cells indicate cases where we observed a significant behavioral phenotype, but the driver line used labeled a combination of cell types. In these cases, our data only allow us to assign the phenotypic effect to that group of MBONs. The light colored cells indicate two cases where our data suggested the involvement of a cell type, but was not conclusive. See Results for details. Avoidance, attraction, wake-promoting and sleep-promoting phenotypes reflect the results of activating MBONs; the other assays measured the effects of blocking synaptic transmission. Activation of glutamatergic MBONs repelled flies and promoted wakefulness, whereas activation of GABAergic or cholinergic MBONs attracted flies and promoted sleep. In general, more cell types were involved in appetitive memory than in aversive memory. Partially overlapping set of cholinergic and glutamatergic MBONs were required for all three appetitive memory assays. The same GABAergic MBON-γ1pedc&gt;α/β was required for short-term olfactory and visual memory in an assay protocol that did not distinguish between formation or retrieval, whereas long-term aversive odor memory retrieval required the V2 cluster MBONs.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04580.032">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04580.032</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-04580-fig13-v1"/></fig></p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The ensemble of MBONs represents valence and biases choice</title><p>We demonstrated that optogenetic activation of MBONs in untrained flies can induce approach or avoidance. The ability of the MBONs to induce changes in behavior in the absence of odors suggests that MBONs can bias behavior directly. This observation is consistent with a recent study showing that flies are able to associate artificial activation of a random set of KCs—instead of an odor stimulus—with electric shock, and avoid reactivation of the same set of KCs in the absence of odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Vasmer et al., 2014</xref>), a result that recapitulates a finding in the potentially analogous piriform cortex of rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Choi et al., 2011</xref>). We found that the sign of the response to MBON activation was highly correlated with neurotransmitter type; all the MBONs whose activation resulted in avoidance were glutamatergic, whereas all the attractive MBONs were cholinergic or GABAergic.</p><p>By tracking flies as they encounter a border between darkness and CsChrimson-activating light, we showed that activation of an MBON can bias walking direction. Although activation of glutamatergic MBONs repelled flies, the avoidance behaviors were not stereotyped; flies showed a variety of motor patterns when avoiding the red light. This observation implies that MBONs are unlikely to function as command neurons to drive a specific motor pattern, as has been observed, for example, in recently identified descending neurons that induce only stereotyped backward walking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bath et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bidaye et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Rather, we view fly locomotion as a goal-directed system that uses changes in MBON activity as an internal guide for taxis. For example, walking in a direction that increases the relative activity of aversive-encoding MBONs, which would occur as a fly approaches an odorant it had previously learned to associate with punishment (or when a fly expressing CsChrimson in an avoidance-inducing MBON approaches the CsChrimson activating light as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), signals the locomotive system to turn around and walk the other direction. Detailed studies of locomotor circuitry will be required to determine the mechanisms of executing such taxic behaviors and should help elucidate how MBON inputs guide this system.</p><p>In this view, the MBON population functions as neither a purely motor nor a purely sensory signal. From the motor perspective, as described above, MBONs bias locomotive outcomes rather than dictate a stereotyped low-level motor program. From the sensory perspective, we have shown that the same MBONs can be required for experience-dependent behavioral plasticity irrespective of whether a conditioned stimulus is a color or an odor, and irrespective of the specific identity of the odor. Taken together with the fact that MBONs lie immediately downstream of the sites of memory formation, these observations support our proposal that MBONs convey that a stimulus has a particular value—but not the identity of the stimulus itself. This contrasts with sensory neurons whose activity can also induce approach or avoidance, but which do convey the stimulus per se. In mammals, neural representations of abstract variables such as ‘value’, ‘risk’ and ‘confidence’ are thought to participate in cognition leading to action selection (for example, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Kepecs et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Kiani and Shadlen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Levy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Yanike and Ferrera, 2014</xref>). From the point of view of this framework, the MBON population representing the value of a learned stimulus and informing locomotion might be operationally viewed as a cognitive primitive.</p><p>Co-activating multiple MBON cell types revealed that the effects of activating different MBONs appear to be additive; that is, activating MBONs with the same sign of action increases the strength of the behavioral response, whereas activating MBONs of opposite sign reduces the behavioral response. Thus, groups of MBONs, rather than individual MBONs, likely act collectively to bias behavioral responses. Consistent with the idea of a distributed MBON population code, all 19 MBON cell types imaged so far show a calcium response to any given odor (Hige et al., unpublished, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Sejourne et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Pai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Placais et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>If it is the ensemble activity of a large number of MBONs that determines memory-guided behavior, how can local modulation of only one or a few MB compartments by dopamine lead to a strong behavioral response? Activation of a single DAN such as PPL1-γ1pedc that innervates a highly localized region of the MB can induce robust aversive memory, yet the odor associated with the punishment will activate MBONs from all compartments, including MBONs that can drive approach as well as those that drive avoidance. We propose that, in response to a novel odor stimulus, the activities of MBONs representing opposing valences may initially be ‘balanced’, so that they do not impose a significant bias. Behavior would then be governed simply by any innate preference a fly might have to that odor, using neuronal circuits not involving the MB. Now suppose an outcome associated with that stimulus is learned. Such learning involves compartment-specific, dopamine-dependent plasticity of the KC-MBON synapses activated by that stimulus. If that occurs, the subsequent ensemble response of the MBONs to that stimulus would no longer be in balance and an attraction to, or avoidance of, that stimulus would result. Consistent with this idea, eliminating MB function by disrupting KCs, which are nearly 10% of neurons in the central brain, had surprisingly minor effects on odor preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">de Belle and Heisenberg, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Heisenberg et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">McGuire et al., 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14</xref> shows a conceptual model of how this could be implemented at the level of neuronal circuits.<fig id="fig14" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04580.033</object-id><label>Figure 14.</label><caption><title>A simplified circuit model for the encoding of learned valence by MBONs ensemble and feedforward network.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In response to an odor, a sparse ensemble of Kenyon cells provides excitatory synaptic input to MBONs (black arrows; Hige et al., unpublished) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Cassenaer and Laurent, 2007</xref>). Glutamatergic (Glu; green), GABAergic (GABA; blue) and cholinergic (Ach; orange) MBONs all receive KC input; the names of MBONs are based on the lobe compartment where their dendrites arborize. CsChrimson activation of some glutamatergic MBONs can be repulsive, whereas activation of GABA or cholinergic MBONs can be attractive (color coded as indicated by the scale at bottom right) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We often only observed significant behavioral effect with combinations of cell types (indicated by dashed lines grouping multiple cell types). MBON-γ1pedc&gt;α/β, and glutamatergic MBONs, MBON-β1&gt;α and MBON-γ4&gt;γ1γ2, have synaptic terminals inside the compartments of MB lobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aso et al., 2014</xref>). While the microcircuits within each MB compartment remain to be elucidated, our light level anatomical studies have enumerated the cell types present in each compartment. The α2 and α3 compartments contain the dendrites of cholinergic MBONs and are targeted by both the GABAergic MBON-γ1pedc&gt;α/β and the glutamatergic MBON-β1&gt;α. These MBONs cover only a small fraction of volume in their target compartments (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>); since they could contact only a fraction of Kenyon cells, we propose that they target MBONs directly. Here we hypothesize that glutamate is inhibitory to cholinergic and GABAergic MBONs, and GABA is inhibitory to glutamatergic MBONs (inhibitory connections are indicated by circles). The thickness of lines and size of their endings are meant to indicate activity levels. (<bold>B</bold>) PPL1- γ1pedc DANs play a major role to mediate punishment signals to the MB for formation of aversive memory together with minor contribution from other DANs including PPL1-γ2α′1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Aso et al., 2012</xref>). If an aversive memory is formed by the simultaneous presentation of an odor and punishment and results in a synaptic depression of KC terminals by dopamine (represented by red dashed circles), the response of the GABAergic MBONs to the CS+ would be depressed (see text). Reduced GABAergic inhibitory input would then increase the CS+ response of glutamatergic MBONs, whereas the CS+ response of cholinergic MBONs would be reduced because of dis-inhibition of the inhibitory glutamatergic MBONs. The end result is enhanced activity of aversion-mediating glutamatergic MBONs together with the reduced activity of attraction-mediating GABAergic and cholinergic MBONs in response to CS+. The CS- is represented by a different set of KCs whose synaptic connections to the MBONs would not be expected to be modified by training and so the responses of the ensemble of MBONs to the CS- would remain balanced. The change in response of the MBONs to the CS+, relative to their unchanged response to the CS-, biases choice toward the CS+ (see diagram in panel <bold>D</bold>). This model is consistent with the essential role of MBON-γ1pedc&gt;α/β in aversive memory. Also, cholinergic MBONs in V2 cluster have been shown to reduce their response to an odor after olfactory conditioning with electric shock (Séjourné et al., Nat. Neurosci., 2011), although we detected their requirement only for long-term memory, but not for 2 hr memory. This model predicts a role for glutamatergic MBONs, but we did not observe significant effect by blocking subsets of glutamtergic MBONs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6 fig8">Figures 6 and 8</xref>). Thus, to test this model, it will be necessary to block broader sets of glutamatergic MBON cell types by using combinations of split-GAL4 drivers. (<bold>C</bold>) In contrast to aversive memory in which one type of DAN (PPL1-γ1pedc) plays a major role in memory formation, reward signals are mediated by a distributed set of PAM cluster DANs that innervate the compartments of glutamatergic MBONs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Yamagata et al., in press</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Burke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Perisse et al., 2013</xref>). If an appetitive memory is formed by synaptic depression of KC terminals in response to dopamine release, the response of the glutamatergic MBONs to the CS + would be depressed. The resultant reduced glutamatergic inhibitory input to the GABAergic and cholinergic MBONs would increase their response to the CS+. In turn, increased GABAergic input to glutamatergic MBONs may further amplify and stabilize the initial effects of plasticity. The end result would be reduced activity of aversion-mediating glutamatergic MBONs together with the increased activity of attraction-mediating GABAergic and cholinergic MBONs in response to CS+. This model is consistent with requirement of glutamatergic MBONs: blocking the M4/M6 cluster MBONs (MBON-γ5β′2a, MBON-β′2mp and MBON-β′2mp_bilateral; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) by MB011B resulted in memory impairment for all three appetitive memory assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7 fig9 fig11">Figures 7, 9 and 11</xref>). Blocking the MBON-γ4&gt;γ1γ2 and MBON-β1&gt;α by MB434B resulted in memory impairment in two of three assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9 fig11">Figures 9 and 11</xref>). While we did not detect a requirement for the GABAergic MBON-γ1ped&gt;α/β in appetitive memory, previous study have shown that dopamine input to the γ1 and pedc suppresses expression of appetitive memory in fed flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Krashes et al., 2009</xref>), indicating some role of MBON-γ1ped&gt;α/β in appetitive memory. Blocking cholinergic MBONs in the V3/V4 cluster (MBON-γ2α′1, MBON-α′2 and MBON-α3) resulted in memory impairment in appetitive odor memories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7 fig11">Figures 7 and 11</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Placais et al., 2013</xref>) but not in appetitive visual memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Some of driver lines for the cholinergic MBONs in the V2 cluster showed impairment of appetitive memory in all three assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7 fig9 fig11">Figures 7, 9 and 11</xref>), although our data did not allow mapping to the resolution of specific cell types due to inconsistent results obtained using other lines. (<bold>D</bold>) In the matrix shown, the number of circles represents the activity levels of MBONs in response to the CS+ odor (the odor that is paired with the unconditioned stimulus during conditioning) and the CS− odor (a control odor). In untrained flies, the activities of MBONs for opposing effects are balanced. Dopamine modulation breaks this balance to bias the choice between CS+ and CS−.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04580.033">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04580.033</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-04580-fig14-v1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Synaptic plasticity underlying associative memory</title><p>Recent studies of dopamine signaling have implicated distinct sites of memory formation within the MB lobes (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Schroll et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Claridge-Chang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Aso et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Burke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Perisse et al., 2013</xref>). Consistent with this large body of work, we found that one type of PPL1 cluster DAN, PPL1-γ1pedc, played a central role in formation of aversive memory in both olfactory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Aso et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Aso et al., 2010</xref>) and visual learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) paradigms. This DAN also mediates aversive reinforcement of bitter taste (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Das et al., 2014</xref>). For appetitive memory, PAM cluster DANs that innervate other regions of the MB lobes, in particular the compartments of glutamatergic MBONs, are sufficient to induce appetitive memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Yamagata et al., in press</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Burke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Liu et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Perisse et al., 2013</xref>). These results strongly suggest that the synaptic plasticity underlying appetitive and aversive memory generally occurs in different compartments of the MB lobes.</p><p>The sign of preference we observed in response to CsChrimson activation of particular MBONs was, in general, opposite to that of the memory induced by dopaminergic input to the corresponding MB compartments. For example, activation of MBON-γ1pedc&gt;α/β and MBON-γ2α′1 attracted flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), whereas DAN input to these regions induced aversive memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Aso et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2012</xref>). Conversely, activation of glutamatergic MBONs repelled flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), while DAN input to the corresponding regions is known to induce appetitive memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Yamagata et al., in press</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Burke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Liu et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Perisse et al., 2013</xref>). These results are most easily explained if dopamine modulation led to synaptic depression of the outputs of the KCs representing the CS + stimulus. Consistent with this mechanism, the PE1 MBONs in honeybees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Okada et al., 2007</xref>) as well as the V2 cluster MBONs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Sejourne et al., 2011</xref>) reduce their response to a learned odor and depression of KC-MBON synapses has been shown for octopamine modulation in the locust MB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Cassenaer and Laurent, 2012</xref>). Moreover, long-term synaptic depression is known to occur in the granular cell synapses to Purkinje cells in the vertebrate cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ito et al., 1982</xref>), a local neuronal circuit with many analogies to the MB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Schurmann, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Laurent, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Farris, 2011</xref>). Other mechanisms are also possible and multiple mechanisms are likely to be used. For example, dopamine may modulate terminals of KCs to potentiate release of an inhibitory cotransmitter such as short neuropeptide F, which has been demonstrated to be functional in KCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Knapek et al., 2013</xref>) and hyperpolarizes cells expressing the sNPF receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Shang et al., 2013</xref>). RNA profiling of MBONs should provide insights into the molecular composition of synapses between KCs and MBONs. It is also noteworthy that the effect of dopamine can be dependent on the activity status of Kenyon cells; activation of PPL1-γ1pedc together with odor presentation induces memory, while its activation without an odor has been reported to erase memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Berry et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Placais et al., 2012</xref>). In the vertebrate basal ganglia, dopamine dependent synaptic plasticity important for aversive and appetitive learning is known to result in both synaptic potentiation and synaptic depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Shen et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Requirements for MBONs differ between behaviors</title><p>In this study, we looked at the effects of selectively and specifically manipulating the activities of a comprehensive set of MBONs on several behaviors. As a consequence, we gained some insights into the extent to which the relative importance of particular MBONs differed between behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref>). Most obvious was the segregation between appetitive and aversive behaviors. For example, we found that blocking MBON-γ1pedc&gt;α/β impaired both short-term aversive odor and visual memory, suggesting a general role in aversive memory independent of modality. Conversely, a subset of glutamatergic MBONs was required in all three appetitive memory assays. It still remains to be demonstrated that the outputs of these MBONs are required transiently during memory retrieval. Nevertheless, CsChrimson activation experiments demonstrate that activation of these MBONs can directly and transiently induce attraction and avoidance behaviors.</p><p>In the cases described above, the DANs and MBONs mediating a particular behavior innervate the same regions of MB lobes. We also found cases where the DANs and MBONs required for a behavior do not innervate the same compartments of the MB lobes. For example, even though several cholinergic MBONs are required for appetitive memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Placais et al., 2013</xref>), the compartments with cholinergic MBONs do not receive inputs from reward-mediating PAM cluster DANs, but instead from PPL1 cluster DANs that have been shown to be dispensable for odor-sugar memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Schwaerzel et al., 2003</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). What accounts for this mismatch? Perhaps these cholinergic MBONs' primarily function is in memory consolidation rather than retrieval. But the fact that CsChrimson activation of the cholinergic MBON-γ2α′1 and V2 cluster MBONs resulted in attraction, strongly suggests that at least some of the cholinergic MBONs have a role in directly mediating the conditioned response. Indeed, previous studies found a requirement for cholinergic MBONs (the V2 cluster and MBON-α3) during memory retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Sejourne et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Pai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Placais et al., 2013</xref>). One attractive model is that requirement of cholinergic MBONs originates from the transfer of information between disparate regions of the MB lobes through the inter-compartmental MBONs connections within the lobes or by way of connections outside the MB, like those described in the next two sections.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Roles for the multilayered network of MBONs</title><p>The multilayered arrangement of MBONs (see Figure 17 of the accompanying manuscript) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aso et al., 2014</xref>) provides a circuit mechanism that enables local modulation in one compartment to affect the response of MBONs in other compartments. Once local modulation breaks the balance between MBONs, these inter-compartmental connections could amplify the differential level of activity of MBONs for opposing effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14</xref>). For example, the avoidance-mediating MBON-γ4&gt;γ1γ2 targets the compartments of attraction-mediating MBON-γ2α′1 and MBON-γ1pedc&gt;α/β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14</xref>).</p><p>This network topology might also provide a fly with the ability to modify its sensory associations in response to a changing environment (see Discussion in the accompanying manuscript) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aso et al., 2014</xref>).

Previous studies and our results indicate that circuits in the α lobe play key roles in long-term aversive and appetitive memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Pascual and Preat, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Isabel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">Yu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Blum et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Sejourne et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Cervantes-Sandoval et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Pai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Placais et al., 2013</xref>). The α lobe is targeted by MBONs from other compartments and comprises the last layer in the layered output model of the MB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; see also Figure 17 of the accompanying manuscript) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aso et al., 2014</xref>). The GABAergic MBON-γ1pedc&gt;α/β and the glutamatergic MBON-β1&gt;α both project to α2 and α3, where their axonal termini lie in close apposition (see Figure 17 of the accompanying manuscript) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aso et al., 2014</xref>). DAN input to the compartments housing the dendrites of these feedforward MBONs induces aversive and appetitive memory, respectively (this work) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Perisse et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Yamagata et al., in press</xref>). As pointed out in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aso et al., 2014</xref>), this circuit structure is well-suited to deal with conflicts between long-lasting memory traces and the need to adapt to survive in a dynamic environment where the meaning of a given sensory input may change. To test the proposed role of the layered arrangement of MBONs in resolving conflicts between old memories and new sensory inputs, we will also need behavioral paradigms that, unlike the simple associative learning tasks used in our current study, assess the neuronal requirements for memory extinction and reversal learning.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Network nodes for integrating innate and learned valences</title><p>The neuronal circuits that are downstream of the MBONs and that might read the ensemble of MBON activity remain to be discovered. However, the anatomy of the MBONs suggests that, at least in some cases, summation and canceling effects may result from convergence of MBON terminals on common targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aso et al., 2014</xref>). For example, the terminals of the sleep-promoting cholinergic MBON-γ2α′1 overlap with terminals of wake-promoting glutamatergic MBONs (γ5β′2a, β′2mp and β′2mp bilateral) in a confined area in CRE and SMP. In addition, some MBONs appear to terminate on the dendrites of DANs innervating other compartments, forming feedback loops. Using these mechanisms, local modulation in a specific compartment could broadly impact the ensemble of MBON activity and how it is interpreted.</p><p>Testing these and other models for the roles of the MBON network, both within the MB lobes and in the surrounding neuropils, will be facilitated by an EM-level connectome to confirm the synaptic connections we have inferred based on light microscopy. We will also need physiological assays to confirm the sign of synaptic connections and to measure plasticity. For example, we do not know the sign of action of glutamate in the targets of glutamatergic MBONs, as this depends on the receptor expressed by the target cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Xia et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Jan and Jan, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Liu and Wilson, 2013</xref>).

We propose that these convergence zones serve as network nodes where behavioral output is selected in the light of both the innate and learned valences of stimuli. What are the neurons downstream to these convergence zones? One obvious possibility is neurons that project to the fan-shaped body of the central complex whose dendrites are known to widely arborize in these same areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hanesch et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Young and Armstrong, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ito et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">Yu et al., 2013</xref>).

For example, consider the MBONs from the α/β lobes. The output of the α/β Kenyon cells is known to be required for retrieval of aversive memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Isabel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Krashes et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">McGuire et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Cervantes-Sandoval et al., 2013</xref>). Our anatomical and behavioral results show that MBON-γ1pedc&gt;α/β, a cell type we found to be critical for aversive memory, has terminals largely confined inside the α/β lobes, well-positioned to regulate a total 6 types of MBONs from the α/β lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Yet we did not detect a requirement for any of these MBONs in short term aversive memory when tested individually. The ability to detect phenotypes also depends on the strength of the effector; for example, four glutamatergic MBON drivers showed aversive memory impairment in initial screening assays with a strong inhibitor of synaptic function, but we were not able to confirm these effects using a weaker effector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><p>The failure to see effects when inactivating individual cell types is most easily explained by combinatorial roles and redundancy between MBONs. We note that this high level of resiliency is very reminiscent of observations made with genetic networks, where less than half of gene knockouts of evolutionarily conserved <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes result in a detectable phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ashburner et al., 1999</xref>). Whether or not we detect a requirement for a particular MBON in a particular learning paradigm is likely to depend on which DANs are recruited by the US used in that paradigm as well as the degree of redundancy in the MBON representation of valence. It will be informative to test systematically whether blocking combinations of MBONs, which did not show significant behavioral effect when blocked separately, results in significant memory impairment. It will also be important in future experiments to employ imaging and electrophysiological methods, in which the activities of individual neurons, and the consequences of plasticity, can be observed without being obscured by redundancy.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Origin of diverse functions of MBONs</title><p>The MBs are implicated in functions beyond processing of associative memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Martin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Liu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Joiner et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Pitman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Hong et al., 2008</xref>). MBONs that influence approach to, or avoidance of, a learned stimulus may also have roles in innate preference behaviors for temperature and hunger-dependent CO2 avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Hong et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Bracker et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, we expect the behavioral repertoire that MBONs govern to go beyond simple approach and avoidance; the MB is known to play a role in experience-dependent regulation of proboscis extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Masek and Scott, 2010</xref>) and courtship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">McBride et al., 1999</xref>) as well as regulation of sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Joiner et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Pitman et al., 2006</xref>) and post-mating behaviors such as oviposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Fleischmann et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Azanchi et al., 2013</xref>). Intriguingly, we found that MBONs whose activation was repulsive promoted wakefulness, whereas MBONs whose activation was attractive promoted sleep; it would make sense for flies to be awake and attentive in an adverse environment. Other internal states, in addition to sleep, are likely to affect the decision to carry out a particular memory-guided behavior; for example, the state of satiety has been shown to regulate memory expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Krashes et al., 2009</xref>). The diverse influences of MBONs on behavior can be most easily explained if we assume that the activity of the ensemble of MBON conveys an abstract representation of both valence and internal state. In this view, the ensemble of MBONs may represent internal states along axes such as pleasant-unpleasant or aroused-not aroused.

The relative expression levels in individual cell types are presented as a 0–5 unit gray scale based on the intensity of the signals in the dendrites obtained for each cell type in each split-GAL4 line. The signal intensity depends on the morphology of individual cell types as well as how many cells of the same cell type innervate the same compartment; thus comparing intensities across cell types is less accurate than the comparisons between lines for the same cell type.</p><p>Since the purpose of obtaining these data was to estimate the expression levels of the UAS-effectors used to manipulate cell function, and expression levels are known to vary with genomic insertion site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Pfeiffer et al., 2010</xref>), we sought to collect expression data using UAS-indicator lines inserted into the same genomic location as the effectors. We believe that this practice addresses a potential weakness in many prior studies where expression patterns have been determined with an indicator construct inserted in one chromosomal site, while perturbing function with an effector residing at another site. The lack of precise correlation between the expression pattern of the indicator and effector introduces significant uncertainty. The best practice would be to directly measure the expression of the effector protein itself, something we were able to do for the red-shifted channel rhodopsin CsChrimson-mVenus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Klapoetke et al., 2014</xref>) by staining for mVenus. The next best approach is to have the indicator of expression and the effector inserted at the same chromosomal location, which we were able to achieve for all cases except the assays of the 2 hr aversive and appetitive odor memory which used a weaker UAS-Shibire effector based on a P-element insertion. We used the following UAS-indicators for the matrices shown in Figures: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <italic>20XUAS-CsChrimson-mVenus</italic> (<italic>attP18</italic>) reared at 22°C; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7 fig9 fig10 fig11">Figures 7B, 9B, 10B, 11B</xref>, <italic>pJFRC2-10XUAS-IVS-mCD8::GFP</italic> (<italic>VK00005</italic>) reared at 18°C [similar expression was observed with <italic>pJFRC225-5xUAS-IVS-myr::smGFP-FLAG</italic> (<italic>VK00005</italic>) reared at 25°C]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12B</xref>, <italic>pJFRC200-10xUAS-IVS-myr::smGFP-HA</italic> (<italic>attP18</italic>) reared at 22°C.

These drivers have much more restricted expression patterns than those previously used, allowing greater certainty in assigning the effects of perturbations to specific cells. Even with these improved GAL4 drivers, there can be significant variation in expression levels between drivers or in different cell types within the expression pattern of a single driver, as well as off-target expression and variations in genetic background. To assign a function to a cell population, we therefore required that the effects of a manipulation be observed using two different GAL4 drivers for that cell population. In cases where we only had one split-GAL4 driver for a cell type, we believe it is only appropriate to interpret an observed phenotype as suggestive, except in cases where we were confirming a previously published result. Finally, we interpret some results as simply raising the possibility of a role for a cell type. For example, where one GAL4 line resulted in a significant effect, but a second line with a very similar expression pattern did not. There were also cases where we saw a consistent tendency in multiple lines, but where none of the individual lines themselves reached statistical significance.</p><p>Detailed methods for immunohistochemistry and image analysis are described in the accompanying manuscript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aso et al., 2014</xref>).

We also performed behavioral assays to verify that the animals carrying the driver line and effector were able to perceive odors, electric shocks and sugar rewards (see Results).

Only one line, MB549C, showed a significant reduction in walking speed, though subsequent analysis suggests this reduction in speed was due to the genetic background of that line rather than silencing of MBONs. Thus flies can move and orient themselves when MBONs, and any neurons with off-target expression in these split-GAL4 drivers, are inactivated and the small differences from wild-type would not be expected to significantly affect behavior in the assays we performed that used Shibire as an effector.</p><p>We also assayed the behavior of flies from each split-GAL4 driver line in a high-throughput open-field arena described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Kabra et al., 2013</xref>) for 15 min during dTrpA1 activation using <italic>10X UAS-dTRPA1</italic> (<italic>attP16</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hamada et al., 2008</xref>) at 30°C.

For all screen hits, waking activity was calculated as the number of beam crossings/min when the fly was awake; consistent with the assays performed in the Flybowl, none of the lines had discernable locomotor defects. Statistical comparisons between experimental and control genotypes were performed using Prism (Graphpad Inc) by Kruskal Wallis One way ANOVA followed by Dunn's post-test.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Sung Soo Kim, TJ Florence, Michael Reiser, Igor Negrashov, Steven Sawtelle, Jinyang Liu for help in establishing the optogenetics apparatus.

For each line, we compared the fraction of time the split-GAL4/dTrpA1 line does each of 14 behaviors to two controls: empty GAL4 crossed to dTrpA1 (pBDPGAL4U/dTrpA1) and split-GAL4/+. Each data point corresponds to the fraction of time that all 20 flies in a given video performed the given behavior. The table contains a dash if the behavioral differences to both controls had different signs. Otherwise, we use the Wilcoxon rank-sum test to compare to each control separately, adjust the p-value using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction for controlling the false discovery rate to 0.05, and report the (conservative) maximum adjusted p-value of the comparison to each control. The average number of videos (n) analyzed for each split-GAL4/TrpA1 line was 5.0, for each split-GAL4/+ line was 4.2, and for the pBDPGAL4U/TrpA1 line was 143.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link

The Reviewing editor has included below the comments from three reviewers. The reviewers are impressed by the study, and most comments are meant to help further improve/clarify the presentation and can be address by textual changes. We hope that your revised manuscript will address these points.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1:</italic></p><p>This paper provides the first behavioral look at the function of newly identified MBONs. The authors (and they are multitude, reflecting the need for expertise for each behavior examined) suggest the major function of MBONs is to encode valence. In this view MB outputs are not themselves driving motor patterns, but rather they are setting the bias to favor some subset of the possible motor programs. The support for this idea is necessarily at this point somewhat circumstantial, but the upshot of the behavioral experiments is that many different behaviors require the exact same MBON or set of MBONs. The commonality between the behavioral situations does not have to do with the qualities or sensory mode of the stimulus, but rather with whether or not the animal likes or dislikes it. Importantly, the isolated activation of these neurons can be shown, in some cases, to appear to drive the animal to behave as if it has an aversion or attraction. The small number of MBONs coupled with the large number of MB-influenced behaviors demand this type of model, since one-to-one connections with motor systems would simply be anatomically untenable.</p><p>I have no substantive negatives. Overall, I think that this is an incredibly important study for several reasons. First, it is a catalog of the functional anatomy of MBONs, laying out the first pass results of what happens in several behavioral contexts when you manipulate their activity. This will be an important resource for many in the community. Second, and critically, this paper goes beyond cataloging to give us a credible model of what this piece of brain is built to do. This is something that will be important for anyone working in any nervous system who is interested in how behavioral decisions are made.</p><p>The way the paper was written also deserves comment. It is very dense and very broad ranging due to the sheer number of experiments done. In spite of this, the paper manages to very clearly deliver its bottom lines, keeping the reader's eye on the message during the first read through. The details are all there when you are ready to go back to look at them, but they don't distract. This will allow a wide range of readers to access this paper and actually get something out of it. I also like the ”Rosetta Stone“ in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> that provides orientation necessary to integrate this study with the previous literature.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This is a beautiful work that attacks most fundamental but highly difficult problem in the field of neuroscience: how valence is encoded within a neural network and how memory is associated with such organization. It fully takes advantage of accessibility to powerful genetic tools available to <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The proposed model is insightful and supported by a large body of data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3</italic>:</p><p>First, I want to say that this is a magnum opus that will become an instant classic in this field. This is the sort of paper that we have all expected to see come out of the Janelia effort in flies. It is the sort of study where the impact is even greater than would be expected by addition of the parts.</p><p>The authors took a systematic approach, a systems biology approach, to attack what is really the next big question in the ”mushroom body field“: what do mushroom bodies actually do. A huge body of literature coming from several different insect species (not just <italic>Drosophila</italic>; maybe check to see that some of the other insects are cited early on?) has already established that mushroom bodies are a multi-modal integration center. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the bulk of the work on the question “what do MBs do” has come from dissection of olfactory associative memory. In this paper, and accompanying manuscripts, the authors take a big step towards answering this question by systematically cataloging and then manipulating the MB output neurons. After generating reagents to manipulate each of the individual MBONs, the effects of these manipulations were then measured in the context of a series of well-studied MB dependent behaviors. These include innate responses to odor (including attraction vs avoidance), aversive and appetitive odor memory, aversive and appetitive visual learning, aversive and appetitive ethanol learning, and sleep.</p><p>There is of course an impressive amount of effort that underlies this study. But what really makes this manuscript compelling for a high impact journal is that the findings are synthetic. Conceptual themes emerge that would not be apparent if one studied a subset of MBONs or only one behavior. What emerges is an over-arching hypothesis in which MBs integrate information about the environment (including internal state and past experience) and where activity in individual groups of MBONs bias responses towards outputs that are adaptive given the valance of the stimuli. And these findings hang together for the most part in terms of how MBONs group together in terms of valence in the innate responses, impact on memory, and neurotransmitter types.</p><p>On one level, this model is basically how we might have all imagined this could work. But to see the model emerge elegantly from an exhaustive data set is startling nevertheless. Moreover, this study provides starting points for countless follow up studies. Specific hypotheses need to be tested, but this study provides a roadmap and a toolbox to do that. So this will have immense impact on the field.</p><p>Overall, I am really enthusiastic about this manuscript. All of my critiques are subordinate to the above positive comments.</p><p>Specific critiques (combining all reviewers):</p><p>1) Blocking MB output has an all or none impact on memory retrieval. But blocking individual MBONs has smaller impact. This is expected, and is discussed. But there are cases where the added impact of blocking individual MBONs doesn’t add up to the whole behavior. The most striking example is aversive olfactory memory, where only one MBON (gamma-ped&gt;alpha/beta) has an effect, and the effect is partial. This can be explained of course by the potential that combinations of other MBONs can impact (i.e. redundancy), or conceptually at least by there being unknown MBONs. This should be discussed.</p><p>2) There is a significant literature on the roles of each of the major MB KC subsets. This consists of two types of experiment: genetic rescue experiments in which individual mutations are rescued with spatially restricted transgene expression, and experiments in which individual KC classes are silenced/activated. The findings with MBONs here are not really integrated into in the Discussion section. The most clear example of this is the MBON-gamma-ped&gt;alpha/beta neuron. In aversive olfactory conditioning, all relevant DA input to DopR comes in through gamma lobes during learning, and retrieval and consolidation involve alpha/beta. So this MBON is ideally positioned to play an important role, but this wasn’t discussed in the text. On the other hand, in appetitive learning, there is evidence (actually from one of the authors) that early and later memories are parallel in gamma and alpha/beta. Again, this is not really discussed. I realize that the manuscript is long, has many findings, and it is not possible to place every finding in context. But this MBON is one of the few that is front and center in this study, so I thought these findings should be integrated better conceptually into the literature.</p><p>3) Related to above, in general, the role of individual lobes, the sequential use of MB lobes, the role for ongoing neural activity (prime lobes, APL, DPM) are not really incorporated into the framework provided in the discussion. Since some of the MBONs provide feedback (which is mentioned), i thought this should be better/more explicitly framed.</p><p>4) Although the MBON anatomy is documented in a different study, there are many cases in this manuscript where MBON labeling in individual panels (mostly in supplement) are almost impossible to see. I think the authors should provide insets with higher magnification b/c many of the neurons are too small to see when the entire CNS is shown.</p><p>5) In the description of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref> findings, it is stated that naive responses to sugar are normal at restrictive temperature for all the lines. When I look at the figure, it appears that it is true that none are different from control, but some lines are higher and some lower than control, and my guess is that the higher lines are significantly different from the lower lines. This is a blemish in the data. Of course all papers have some blemishes, but I think the authors should state the statistical difference if there is one and just make the case that it is not a major concern.</p><p>6) In the sleep section, there is no rebound effect after 2 nights of sleep loss (in the lines that reduce sleep). Why?</p><p>7) This study crosses many sub-fields, so citation is really not trivial to organize. But I see a few omissions where previous work was not emphasized enough (IMHO). Including these could improve the Discussion section, and will avoid inadvertently annoying a few colleagues:</p><p>Citation omissions/mis-citations:</p><p>In my opinion, Marin et al.

This should be discussed</italic>.</p><p>As we discussed in the first section of Results and the section of Discussion “Dealing with redundancy and resiliency of networks”, our experimental protocols are likely to result in false negatives. There are several reasons for this. Most importantly, the effects of blocking the small number of cells in individual lines might not rise above the inherent noise of behavioral assays to become statistically significant. Consider the case of olfactory aversive learning pointed out by the reviewer. One neuron, a GABAergic MBON, had a strong effect, but still only resulted in 40-50% reduction compared to the controls. However, in the initial screening with a strong effector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), we observed that four glutamatergic MBONs lines had an effect in our initial screening assays, but these same lines did not give a significant effect when subsequently retested with a weaker effector. The simplest explanation of these observations is that these individual MBONs had effects that were only obvious when using a strong effector. Further experiments will be required, but we suspect that these lines do play a role in aversive memory and in combination would produce significant effects with either effector.</p><p>We added the following two sentences to highlight the possible role of glutamatergic MBONs in aversive memory:</p><p>“The ability to detect phenotypes also depends on the strength of the effector; for example, four glutamatergic MBON drivers showed aversive memory impairment in initial screening assays with a strong inhibitor of synaptic function, but we were not able to confirm these effects using a weaker effector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).”</p><p>Similarly in the Chrimson activation assays and in long term aversive odor memory, lines expressing in a combination of several cell types gave significant effects but lines for the individual cell types did not. The negative data could be due to too weak or too strong expression of the effector as well as off-targeted expression. To explore such possibility, we have repeated the choice assay of 7 driver lines using 5x, 10x, 20xUAS-CsChrimson in attP18. Presumably depending on the intensity of driver, we observed much weaker or no significant phenotype with 5xUAS-CsChrimson for majority of lines. Conversely, in some driver lines, we observed significant effect with 10xUAS-CsChrimson but not with 20xUAS-CsChrimson. This is possibly due to toxicity of 20xUAS-CsChrimson when expressed at too high level; CsChrimson driven with pan-neuronal drivers such as elav-GAL4 and R57C10-GAL4 are lethal. Because these experiments are preliminary we did not add them to the paper, but did include the following sentence in Materials and Methods: “Only data obtained with 20x<italic>20XUAS-CsChrimson-mVenus</italic> (<italic>attP18</italic>) are shown in this study. Our preliminary results with 5<italic>XUAS-CsChrimson-mVenus</italic> (<italic>attP18</italic>) or <italic>10XUAS-CsChrimson-mVenus</italic> (<italic>attP18</italic>) indicate that either too weak or too strong expression may result in the failure to observe a phenotype.”</p><p>It is also formal possibility that we are missing the additional MBONs, but we think this is unlikely (see anatomy paper).</p><p><italic>2) There is a significant literature on the roles of each of the major MB KC subsets. This consists of two types of experiment: genetic rescue experiments in which individual mutations are rescued with spatially restricted transgene expression, and experiments in which individual KC classes are silenced/activated.

But this MBON is one of the few that is front and center in this study, so I thought these findings should be integrated better conceptually into the literature</italic>.</p><p>We added the following sentence to highlight previous studies of dopamine receptor rescue:</p><p>“Consistent with these observations, restoring expression of the D1-like dopamine receptor specifically in the γ Kenyon cells has been shown to rescue the aversive odor memory defect of a receptor mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Qin et al., 2012a</xref>).”</p><p>We believe the following existing sentences address the reviewer’s request for discussion of the fact that “In aversive olfactory conditioning, all relevant DA input to DopR comes in through gamma lobes during learning, and retrieval and consolidation involve alpha/beta.”</p><p>“One attractive model is that requirement of cholinergic MBONs originates from the transfer of information between disparate regions of the MB lobes through the inter-compartmental MBONs connections within the lobes or by way of connections outside the MB, like those described in the next two sections.”</p><p>“The multilayered arrangement of MBONs (see Figure 17 of the accompanying manuscript) (Aso et al., submitted) provides a circuit mechanism that enables local modulation in one compartment to affect the response of MBONs in other compartments.”</p><p>“The GABAergic MBON-γ1pedc&gt;α/β and the glutamatergic MBON-β1&gt;α both project to α2 and α3, where their axonal termini lie in close apposition (see Figure 17 of the accompanying manuscript) (Aso et al., submitted). DAN input to the compartments housing the dendrites of these feedforward MBONs induces aversive and appetitive memory, respectively (this work)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Perisse et al., 2013</xref>, Yamagata et al., submitted).”</p><p><italic>3) Related to above, in general, the role of individual lobes, the sequential use of MB lobes, the role for ongoing neural activity (prime lobes, APL, DPM) are not really incorporated into the framework provided in the discussion. Since some of the MBONs provide feedback (which is mentioned), i thought this should be better/more explicitly framed</italic>.</p><p>Since nearly all of our behavior assays did not measure MBON function during memory consolidation, we have little new to say on this subject. Given the length of the manuscript we chose not to include extensive discussion of subjects were our data could not make a substantive contribution.</p><p><italic>4) Although the MBON anatomy is documented in a different study, there are many cases in this manuscript where MBON labeling in individual panels (mostly in supplement) are almost impossible to see.

We are proving the original confocal stacks for download at a web site referred to in the text and we added a sentence “Full confocal stacks of these images are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.janelia.org/split-gal4">www.janelia.org/split-gal4</ext-link>” in the Materials and Methods and the relevant Figure legends.

As this reviewer pointed out, 210B/shi was statistically different from 542B/shi. However, this difference does not account for memory impairment of these lines compared to the control.</p><p><italic>6) In the sleep section, there is no rebound effect after 2 nights of sleep loss (in the lines that reduce sleep). Why?</italic></p><p>The reviewer correctly points out that we did not consistently observe significant sleep rebound in these experiments; additional studies will be required to understand this observation. We quantified sleep rebound post dTRPA1 activation that induces sleep loss in 210B and 434B. We found sleep rebound in 210B significantly different from genotypic controls. However, this was not the case for 434B. We reason that 210B loses more sleep than 434B and hence shows more robust sleep rebound. To understand the exact quantitative relationship between amounts of sleep lost and subsequent sleep rebound, and why this may differ between wake-promoting split-GAL4 lines, will require additional studies.</p><p><italic>7) This study crosses many sub-fields, so citation is really not trivial to organize.
